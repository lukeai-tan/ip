[38;5;88m[Red Girls] System Online.
I am here to assist... or observe.

Available commands:

  ? list      : Display all current tasks. I see everything you have accumulated.
  ? todo      : Add a simple task. Even the smallest action matters.
  ? deadline  : Add a task with a due date. Time is relentless; do not waste it.
  ? event     : Schedule an event. Every moment is fleeting.
  ? mark      : Mark a task as complete. Completion... is temporary, yet necessary.
  ? unmark    : Undo a completed task. Mistakes... are expected.
  ? delete    : Remove a task entirely. Erasure... a fate more final than death.
  ? bye       : Terminate this session. I will remember nothing.
  ? help      : Display this list again. Even I grow tired of repetition.

Use your commands wisely. Nothing lasts forever, not even this list.
